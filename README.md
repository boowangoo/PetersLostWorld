This was a game that I developed in grade 11 in NetBeans, using Java's native graphics library. This was clearly a beginner's attempt, as I later found out that, of all the computers that I've tested this game on, it will only run reliably on 50% of them.

Unfortunately, I have lost the source code to this file, only the jar remains. I may make an attempt at decompiling in the future, but the chances of that are admitably slim.
